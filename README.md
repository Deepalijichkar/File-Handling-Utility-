As part of my internship at CODTECH IT SOLUTIONS, I was assigned a core Java project focusing on file handling operations, which served as the first task in a four-task series. The goal of this task was to develop a complete Java-based file utility that demonstrates the three primary operations involving text files: writing to a file, reading from a file, and modifying file content. I completed this task using Visual Studio Code (VS Code) as the development environment, taking full advantage of its features such as IntelliSense, integrated terminal, and debugging support to write, compile, and run the code efficiently. This project aimed to strengthen my practical understanding of Java I/O (Input/Output) streams, particularly classes like BufferedWriter, BufferedReader, FileReader, and FileWriter, all of which are fundamental to building file-based utilities in Java.

The file handling script I developed consists of three main functionalities: first, writing user-defined content into a file; second, reading and displaying the content of that file on the console; and third, modifying the file by replacing a specific word or phrase with a new one. These operations are built into a single, well-structured Java program named FileUtility.java, which I wrote inside VS Code. The interface is simple and interactive — the user is prompted via the terminal to input content to write into the file, and later to specify the word to be replaced and the word to replace it with. The result of each action is shown in the terminal, making the script user-friendly and easy to test. I used meaningful variable names and added inline comments throughout the code to enhance readability and help others understand the logic with ease. In addition, I structured the code in a modular way by breaking it into separate static methods (writeToFile, readFromFile, and modifyFile), each with a single responsibility, making the code maintainable and reusable.

One key learning from this task was how to handle exceptions in Java effectively using try-catch blocks. File handling often involves dealing with potential runtime errors like file not found, permission issues, or read/write failures. My program gracefully handles such scenarios and displays user-friendly error messages, ensuring the program doesn’t crash unexpectedly. Another valuable skill I practiced was working with Java’s Scanner class to capture user input from the console, which made the program more dynamic and interactive. By using BufferedWriter and BufferedReader, I also learned how to perform efficient I/O operations for large text files, which is useful in real-world applications such as log analyzers, configuration editors, and data processors.

To run the code in VS Code, I saved the file as FileUtility.java, compiled it using the terminal with javac FileUtility.java, and executed it with java FileUtility. I ensured that the file name matched the public class name, which is a strict requirement in Java. I also explored VS Code’s terminal navigation and code suggestions to speed up the process. The result is a robust, commented, and beginner-friendly Java script that meets the internship deliverable: a script demonstrating file operations with clear documentation. This task not only reinforced my understanding of Java syntax and structure but also gave me confidence in using a professional IDE like VS Code for software development. I look forward to applying the skills learned here in upcoming tasks during my internship.
